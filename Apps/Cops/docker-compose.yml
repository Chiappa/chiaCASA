    en_us: 'By SÃ©bastien Lucas, Stands For Calibre Opds (and Html) Php Server. Cops Links To Your Calibre Library Database And Allows Downloading And Emailing Of Books Directly From A Web Browser And Provides A Opds Feed To Connect To Your Devices. Changes In Your Calibre Library Are Reflected Immediately In Your Cops Pages. See : cops''s Home For More Details. Don''t Forget To Check The wiki. ## Why? (taken From The Author''s Site) In My Opinion Calibre Is A Marvelous Tool But Is Too Big And Has Too Much Dependencies To Be Used For Its Content Server. That''s The Main Reason Why I Coded This Opds Server. I Needed A Simple Tool To Be Installed On A Small Server (seagate Dockstar In My Case). I Initially Thought Of Calibre2opds But As It Generate Static File No Search Was Possible. Later I Added An Simple Html Catalog That Should Be Usable On My Kobo. So Cops''s Main Advantages Are : * No Need For Many Dependencies. * No Need For A Lot Of Cpu Or Ram. * Not Much Code. * Search Is Available. * With Dropbox / Owncloud It''s Very Easy To Have An Up To Date Opds Server. * It Was Fun To Code. If You Want To Use The Opds Feed Don''t Forget To Specify Feed.php At The End Of Your Url.'

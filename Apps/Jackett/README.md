# Jackett

Works As A Proxy Server: It Translates Queries From Apps (sonarr, Sickrage, Couchpotato, Mylar, Etc) Into Tracker-site-specific Http Queries, Parses The Html Response, Then Sends Results Back To The Requesting Software. This Allows For Getting Recent Uploads (like Rss) And Performing Searches. Jackett Is A Single Repository Of Maintained Indexer Scraping & Translation Logic - Removing The Burden From Other Apps.
